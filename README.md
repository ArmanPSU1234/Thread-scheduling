# Thread-Scheduling

@author: Arman Mannan, Fanzhou Wang
Purpose: thread-based schedulers for an n-processor architecture, n > 1, using the following scheduling policies:
1.	First Come, First Served (FCFS).
2.	Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), without preemption.
3.	SRTF, with preemption.
4.	Priority Based Scheduling (PBS), with preemption.
Description: Using C++ to implement (1) the ‘MyScheduler’ class. (2) implement our own test bench to self-verify the scheduler works as required, evaluate the scheduling, and to ensure schedulers implement policies are correct.
